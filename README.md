## Overview

**Powers Explorer** is an educational application designed for high school mathematics instruction (ages 14-18) that helps students develop intuition about orders of magnitude through interactive visualization. The tool enables exploration of scales ranging from quantum mechanics (Planck length, 10^-35 meters) to cosmic distances (observable universe, 10^26 meters).

### Educational Objectives

- **Scale Comprehension**: Develop intuition for orders of magnitude across 61 powers of ten
- **Comparative Understanding**: Enable direct comparison of cosmic object sizes and distances
- **Speed of Light Visualization**: Make astronomical distances tangible through light travel time
- **Scientific Literacy**: Present accurate scientific data in an engaging, interactive format

### Key Features

#### 🌌 Cosmic Object Comparison Mode
- Select two objects from a curated library of cosmic entities
- View objects at accurate relative scale
- Animate separation to real scaled distances
- Visualize light traveling between objects at true speed
- Display educational facts and scientific measurements

#### 🪐 Solar System Visualization Mode
- **Size Comparison View**: All planets side-by-side with proportional sizes
  - Optional Sun inclusion with dynamic rescaling
  - Minimum visibility threshold ensures all planets are visible
- **Distance View**: Planets positioned at logarithmically-scaled orbital distances
  - AU distance markers for reference
  - Sun positioned at origin
- **Orbital View**: Real-time elliptical orbits with accurate positioning
  - Uses Astronomy Engine for current planetary positions
  - Scientifically accurate orbital mechanics (Sun at focus)
  - Fallback to simulated positions if calculation fails
- Interactive info panels with planetary data and educational facts

#### 🔬 Powers of Ten Explorer Mode *(Coming Soon)*
- Zoom through 61 scale levels using mouse wheel
- Seamless transitions from subatomic to cosmic scales
- Dynamic object rendering based on current scale
- Real-time scale indicators and measurements
- Contextual backgrounds (quantum, terrestrial, space)

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) (v3.70+) - 2D game framework for animations and rendering
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Fast development server with HMR
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Deployment**: Static web hosting 

### Why This Stack?

- **Phaser**: Excellent 2D rendering performance, rich animation system, perfect for educational visualizations
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast dev server, optimized production builds, zero-config setup
- **JavaScript**: Universal browser support, no compilation required, easy to extend
